      <p>Beginning in 2014, a multidisciplinary team of security professionals started
      working with victims of domestic violence, shelters, and advocacy groups in
      order to give them critical safety and security information and resources. This
      project, now known as Operation: Safe Escape, focuses on protecting the victim
      of domestic violence and their family from the moment they decide to leave up
      until they’re at a safe place.</p>

                    <h3 id="avoid-unexplained-changes">Avoid unexplained changes</h3>
            <p>The general idea is to not make any sudden changes to your routine, practices,
            or other behaviors unless they can be readily explained. For example, a “cover
            story” should be created for why you’re setting money aside if asked.</p>
            <h3 id="remember-need-to-know">Remember Need to Know</h3>
            <p>Only tell people about your plans if they absolutely need to know and can be
            trusted. Limit the number of people that know your plan; even if you trust them,
            they may be tricked into giving up your location.</p>
            <h3 id="know-your-plan">Know your plan</h3>
            <p>Think ahead and plan where you can go when you need to leave. Know where to find
            family justice centers- they have free advocates, legal resources and other
            assistance. They also know how to put you in touch with safe houses, food and
            clothing resources and more. Churches may also be able to provide food, gas
            cards, and other resources.</p>
            <h3 id="be-careful-of-your-browsing-history">Be careful of your browsing history</h3>
            <p>Most browsers keep a record of websites you visit. Whenever you’re researching
            new locations, shelters, or anything else related to you plan, use “private
            browsing” or “incognito” mode. Alternately, download the Tor Browser Bundle to
            browse securely. Although the Tor Browser Bundle is a secure, private way to
            browse the internet, be aware that it runs from a folder that may be found. You
            can hide this folder or run it from a thumb drive for added security.</p>
            <p>Also, delete text messages or emails that might reveal your plans.</p>
            <h3 id="keeping-a-go-bag-">Keeping a “Go bag”</h3>
            <p>It’s a good idea to pack a “go bag” with enough clothes, money and essentials to
            last for a few days, as well as important documents and records. However, this
            bag must not be kept anywhere that can be found. Keep it at a safe location,
            such as work, a storage locker, a trusted (and preferably not mutual) friend’s
            house, etc.</p>
            <h3 id="prepare-but-don-t-spend-too-much-time-preparing">Prepare, but don’t spend too much time preparing</h3>
            <p>The longer you take to prepare, the greater the chance of detection. Life and
            safety is more important than any possession; if you need to leave, leave as
            soon as you can. If you have time to take the bare essentials, do so.</p>
            <h3 id="bring-as-much-cash-as-possible-or-know-where-you-can-borrow-some">Bring as much cash as possible, or know where you can borrow some</h3>
            <p>Do not use credit cards if the abuser has any way of seeing what’s been charged
            and where. If you borrow money, make sure it’s from a trusted friend or relative
            that has no connection to the abuser.</p>
            <h3 id="tell-your-kids-what-they-need-to-know">Tell your kids what they need to know</h3>
            <p>Children are likely aware of the violence, but may not be sure what they can or
            can’t share. Tell them that if there’s violence, it’s their job to get to
            safety, not to intervene. Teach them how to find a safe place and call 911.
            Establish an “emergency word” to use with your children, which would indicate
            that they need to get to an established safe area.</p>
            <h3 id="document-the-abuse">Document the abuse</h3>
            <p>Take photos of injuries and save any written or recorded threats. Keep a journal
            documenting incidents. All of this information should be kept in a place
            inaccessible by the abuser, such as a secure email account.</p>
            <h3 id="know-what-to-do-if-you-re-in-immediate-danger">Know what to do if you’re in immediate danger</h3>
            <p>Move away from anywhere with dangerous objects, such as the kitchen or bathroom.
            If possible, secretly designate an area of the house as ‘secure’ by moving any
            dangerous objects out of it. This area should also offer clear escape routes.</p>
            <h3 id="know-your-escape-routes">Know your escape routes</h3>
            <p>Plan ahead for which routes offer quick and safe escape routes. Practice the
            routes with your children, and establish a code word so they know when to escape
            and call the police. Make sure they understand to keep this code word secret.</p>
            <h3 id="prepare-yourself-in-event-of-violence">Prepare yourself in event of violence</h3>
            <p>Avoid clothing that may make violent events more dangerous, such as necklaces or
            scarves.</p>
            <h3 id="secure-weapons">Secure weapons</h3>
            <p>Keep guns locked up and unloaded; secure bladed weapons.</p>
            <h3 id="program-911-into-your-phone">Program 911 into your phone</h3>
            <p>so you don’t have to dial it. If you need to
            secretly get help, you can pretend you’re ordering a pizza or some other food
            delivery. In most sizable cities, 911 operators can find you using your phone’s
            location so know if you’re in one of those areas. If you call 911 but don’t say
            anything, they will find you if possible. Just be careful of the speaker volume.</p>

          <div class="inner">
                    <p>Don’t take the most direct route to your destination. When you leave, head off
            in the opposite direction from where you’re actually headed, just in case
            someone sees you leave and may tell the abuser which direction you went.
            Afterwards, double back and take another route to your actual destination.</p>
            <p>Know what to look for to make sure you’re not being followed. Look several car
            lengths back, not just immediately behind you. If you think you’re being
            followed, simple checks can help to make sure. For example, make a u-turn and
            see if anyone else does the same thing. Drive slightly below the speed limit and
            see if anyone doesn’t pass you. Make a series of turns and see if the same car
            follows you. If you feel you’re being followed, pull into a police station
            parking lot or call the police.</p>
            <p>If your vehicle has OnStar or a similar service, call to either cancel tracking
            entirely or set a password to ensure no one else can find the vehicle’s location
            using their “find my family” service.</p>
            <p>Remove anything identifying from your vehicle, such as bumper stickers or things
            visible in the window or hanging from the mirror.</p>

            <p>Do not take the most direct route to your destination, especially if you are
            going to a location that you’ve been to before. If someone is behind you, walk
            into a well lit and populated area. Avoid moving towards your destination if you
            are being followed.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>You need to look several cars back, not just the ones immediately behind
            you.</li>
            <li>Your car may have a tracker installed, do not, under any circumstances park
            at or near your destination. If possible, walk as far as you can from your
            vehicle, and have an intermediary pick you up and transport you the rest of
            the way. Multiple hops will make you safer, so do so if you can.</li>
            <li>Avoid locations with traffic, it’s actually easier for someone to observe
            you when you’re moving slowly</li>
            <li>If you feel like someone is directly behind you here are some basic things
            that you can do to confirm.</li>
            <li>Wait excessively long at stop signs</li>
            <li>Stop at a green light, and only go through when it turns yellow</li>
            <li>At a stop sign, put your blinker on for the opposite of the direction you
            plan on turning, if the follower does the same, you know with almost
            certainty that you’re being followed.</li>

            <p>It&#39;s a good idea, but remember that the order itself offers no protection. If
            it’s violated, inform the police immediately. Ask if your state grants permanent
            or lifetime orders. Make sure to add your children’s names to the order.</p>
            <h3 id="change-website-passwords">Change website passwords</h3>
            <p>Even if you’re pretty sure that no one else knew them. Make sure to change your
            social media, bank and email passwords. Take this opportunity to enable
            two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as multifactor
            authentication. This can help protect your account even if your password is

            <h3 id="get-a-new-phone">Get a new phone</h3>
            <p>One option is to purchase an inexpensive, reloadable cell phone from any major
            retailer. These phones, commonly referred to as “burner phones” will have no
            connection to the abuser and can help you keep in touch with your support
            system. Another option is to visit a retail location for your provider and have
            them move you over to a new plan. If they don’t offer you a new phone with the
            plan, make sure they perform a factory reset of the device to ensure any apps
            that could track your location are removed. Make sure your new number is
            unlisted.</p>
            <h3 id="consider-deleting-all-social-media-accounts">Consider deleting all social media accounts</h3>
            <p>Posts on social media may directly reveal your location, or it may give
            information that can be used to determine your location. If you choose to keep
            your social media accounts, be very careful posting anything about your location
            or destination. Be 100% certain that the none of the abuser’s coworkers, former
            coworkers, friends, relatives, contacts - anyone that could possibly pass
            information to them - can see your posts. Then, make sure that none of your
            contacts know those people as well.</p>
            <h3 id="get-a-new-email-account">Get a new email account</h3>
            <p>Make a new email account that doesn’t include your name. Don’t back it up with
            any email tied to you or your phone number. You can keep phone numbers, photos,
            and other digital copies in this email account.</p>
            <h3 id="call-the-national-domestic-violence-hotline">Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline</h3>
            <p>If you are in the USA, call <a href="tel:+18007997233">800-799-7233</a> to find shelter
            information, or just if you need to talk. They’re there for you 24/7.</p>
            <h3 id="resist-the-urge-to-contact-family-and-friends">Resist the urge to contact family and friends</h3>
            <p>Avoid using social media or to turn your mobile devices back on until someone
            shows you how to do so safely. These can be used to track you. If you need to
            contact someone (extremely close friends or relatives) ask someone how to do so
            safely. It is normal to want to tell people that you are okay, just have someone
            help you to mitigate the risks</p>

            security rules designed to protect you, other residents, and the shelter staff.
            Although those rules may sometimes seem a little bit restrictive, it’s important
            to follow them for everyone’s safety.</p>
            <p>If the abusive partner had access to your cell phone or your account, you may be
            asked to remove your phone’s battery, and maybe even wrap it in tinfoil to block
            any transmissions. Although this may sound a little bit extreme, this might be
            done because a cell phone may be used to track you or find out where you’re
            going.</p>
            <p>The shelter staff will help you navigate the complex legal issues, such as

            <p>There are several steps that you can take to help decrease the probability that
            you are being tracked, but you need to understand that there is absolutely no
            way to mitigate the risk entirely. Your risk is many times greater if you are
            using the same device that you left with. There are a few steps that you can
            follow to help keep you safe. The following will work for both iOS and Android
            devices</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Disable wifi, bluetooth, and location services anytime that you are not using
            them. These are some of the most common attack vectors.</li>
            <li>Do not remove your device from the faraday cage unless in a public place. You
            could compromise the location of the shelter which could not only endanger you,
            but your peers.</li>
            <li>Use the VPN that the shelter provided to you, and if this service is
            unavailable to you, it is okay to use a commercial service, but this will
            require research on your part.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Android</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the storage on your device is encrypted, for devices running
            android 6.0 or greater this is done by default, for older devices you can do
            this by going to the security settings and enabling it. It will take a long
            time to do, but it is necessary.</li>
            <li>Download Signal and set it as your default messaging client. It can send both
            encrypted messages to other Signal users (Please try to convince everyone to
            use this, as it only increases your safety, especially those who you talk to
            frequently) and regular SMS messages</li>
            <li>Download brave and set it as your default browser</li>
            </ul>
            <p>iOS</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Storage encryption should be enabled by default, assuming you have updated
            your device and it supports iOS 8 or greater</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="your-laptop-is-also-a-major-potential-threat-vector">Your laptop is also a major potential threat vector</h3>
            <p>Reinstall windows if that’s what you are using and you aren’t comfortable with
            changing. It is possible that a bug was installed on your system. Try to create
            the windows installation media on a separate computer (preferably a public one)
            and do the reinstallation offline. This should help protect you. If you are
            comfortable switching operating systems, it is highly advised that you switch to
            Linux.</p>
            <p>Once you have a fresh operating system installed, you should immediately
            <a href="https://Torproject.org">get the Tor browser bundle</a>. From this point onwards,
            you should only connect to the internet through Tor</p>

              <h3>Step 2: Use Technology Safely</h3>
              <p>There’s a certain risk when using your phone or computer to search for
      resources or to communicate with your support system. But there’s a few
      steps you can take to stay safe.

              <p>There’s a certain risk when using your phone or computer to search for resources
      or to communicate with your support system. But there’s a few steps you can take
      to stay safe.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Whenever you’re searching for information that you don’t want anyone to see,
      make sure to use private browsing mode. All major browsers have one.</li>
      <li>Be aware that your phone can be used to track you. Both android and iOS phones
      have apps or built in tools to find lost phones, and tracking apps are easy to
      find. Make sure to turn off your phone’s GPS whenever you don’t want your
      location to be found. Better yet, turn it off and remove the battery. Better
      still, get a new phone and new number as soon as you leave.</li>
      <li>Before using a computer- especially a public one- look for anything plugged
      into the back of the computer between the keyboard and the port. If there’s
      anything there, it might be a keystroke logger. Use a different computer.</li>
      <li>Again, using private browsing mode, create a new email address that has no
      connection to your real identity. Use this address to store reminders to
      yourself, save pictures and important information, and document your escape
      plan.</li>
      <li>When you’re done, type the following command into your start menu to clear
      your DNS cache: ipconfig /flushdns . Otherwise, the DNS record can show the
      sites you’ve visited, even in private browsing mode.</li>
      <li>Next, if you&#39;re on Windows, copy this into your run bar or computer browser:
      <code>%appdata%\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects</code>. This will show any flash
      cookies that may reveal the pages you’ve visited. Delete only the ones you
      want to hide. To delete them without sending them to the recycle bin,
      highlight the entry(s) and press Shift+Delete at the same time.</li>
      <li>Clear only specific pages from your browser history - don’t clear the entire
      history for the day. Here’s how.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Operation: Safe Escape</em> can send you a tool that allows you to search the web
      and communicate with others securely and without leaving a trace. It’s a simple
      thumb drive that you plug into your computer; when you reboot, you’re in an
      entirely new operating system that doesn’t keep track of anything you do.  See
      how it works here.</p>
      <p>We’ll send a free copy with  to a safe address of your choosing. Just let us
      know where to send it:</p>
